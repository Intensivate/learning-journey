# One Day : Chisel Bootcamp
The goal of this bootcamp is to get the attendee up to speed with Scala
and Chisel as quickly as possible. The format should be casual with a lot
of questions and immediate feedback. 
There's a lot of content here so it
is very unlikely that we will get through everything so instead we will
try and get some hands work in each section to get a taste of the concepts.
It is a very good idea to follow up this bootcamp by fully going through every
section.

This will all go faster and smoother if you can prepare a development environment beforehand.
