Background
----------
I came from high-level Scala/Java background and had no previous experience with Chisel, Verilog -- or in-depth understanding of processor architecture for that matter

Learning journey feedback
-------------------------
While it's done in admirable fashion, there are still some points that could be improved:

* It's targeted specifically to people with Verilog background. For those without it it would be beneficial to provide brief descriptions (or links, at least) to what LFSR16 or ALU2 are.
* Source code of many examples don't match exactly between repo and learning journey wiki
* There's little to no docs about "ready/valid interface" and `DecoupledIO`, would be really helpful to have it though.
