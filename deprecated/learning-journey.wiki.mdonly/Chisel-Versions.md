Since Chisel is relatively a new language, it is constantly evolving and being improved.
There are 3 main versions of Chisel at the moment:
* Chisel 1 - not used anymore, only mentioned for historical reasons.
* [Chisel 2](Chisel2) - still used in some parts of our designs.
* Chisel 3 - the newest version.

If you see at the top of the .scala page this import:
"import Chisel._" then that means that the code on the page can be either Chisel 2 or Chisel 3.  Now, you can mix Chisel 2 syntax with Chisel 3 syntax on the same page.

The latest version of Chisel language can be found here: https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/releases.html

The differences between Chisel 2 and Chisel 3 are well described here: https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Chisel3-vs-Chisel2
