**Question**

Chisel contains a Standard Library of Interfaces: 
1. `DecoupledIO` - a Bundle with a ready-valid interface
2. `ValidIO` - a Bundle with a valid interface
3. `Queue` - a Module providing a hardware Queue
4. `Pipe` - a Module delaying input data
5. `Arbiter` - a Module connecting multiple producers to one consumer

How are these interpreted in hardware? What do they synthesize to?
