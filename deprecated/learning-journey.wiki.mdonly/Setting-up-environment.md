VM VirtualBox and Linux installation:
- setting of attributes of VM during creation of the VM in VirtualBox was a bit different in comparison to the steps in manual "Detailed-steps-of-setting-up-environment" - I am using MS Windows 7 (maybe this is the reason).
- issues with shared folder - unable to find the shared folder in Linux
  -> solution: I had to turn on auto-mount in the settings of the shared folder. I recommend to add this into the manual.
Chisel installation:
- otherwise, the manual is very good and everything else was very smooth. I really appreciate the script that is doing almost all the work fully automatically. Thanks.
