## Purpose

Chisel 2 has been deprecated for some time now, however certain parts of Rocket-Chip remain coded in Chisel 2. Using the compatibility package, they can still run in the Chisel 3 context. In this page we collect resources to Chisel 2 to help out those learners and designers that need to get things done within code that never got upgraded from Chisel 2.
