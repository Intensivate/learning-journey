Welcome to the Chisel Learning Journey!

[Chisel](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3) is a hardware construction language that supports advanced hardware design and circuit generation.

This Journey is built around the examples provided by the creators of Chisel, within their [tutorial](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-tutorial).

Please clone the Learning Journey:

```
git clone https://github.com/apaj/learning-journey.git

```

and run the script that sets everything up for you:

```

and follow along simple instructions.

Once the script is finished, please embark on the [Chisel Learning Journey](https://github.com/librecores/riscv-sodor/wiki).
