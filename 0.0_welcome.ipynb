    "The Learning journey is a simplified hand-holding step by step way for those new to Chisel to quickly and easily ramp up and become productive. As of June 2020, we've merged the Learning Journey with the [Chisel Bootcamp](https://github.com/chisel-bootcamp), therefore the basic examples are now interactive and the advanced examples from the Learning Journey are added to the end as-is. The first pages of this jupyter notbook are dedicated to important aspects of Chisel from Intensivate's point of view \n",
